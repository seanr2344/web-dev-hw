      <h1> Will Smith Quotes <h1>
        <h2> Inspiration: Talent and Skill <h2>


          <div class="text">
            <p> “The separation of talent and skill is one of the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel, who have dreams and who wanna do things. Talent you have naturally, skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft. <p>

              <p> I’ve never really viewed myself as particularly talented, where I excel is ridiculous, sickening, work-ethic. You know while the other guys sleeping, I’m working, while the other guy’s eating, I’m working. I realised very very young that there’s no easy way around it, no matter how talented you are your talent is going to fail you if you’re not skilled, if you don’t study, if you don’t work really hard and dedicate yourself to being better every single day you’ll never be able to communicate with people with your artistry the way that you want.” – Will Smith Motivation <p>

                <p> “The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is – I’m not afraid to die on a treadmill. You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me you might be all of those things you got it on me in 9 categories. But if we get on the treadmill together there’s two things – you’re getting off first, or I’m going to die. It’s really that simple. You’re not going to out work me, it’s such a simple concept – the majority of people who aren’t getting to places they want or aren’t achieving the things that they want it’s strictly based on being outworked and missing crucial opportunities. I say all the time if you stay ready, you ain’t gotta get ready.” – Will Smith Motivation <p>
