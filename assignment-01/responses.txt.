The web is different from the internet because the internet is a global network of networks while the web, is a collection of information which is accessed through the internet.
How the internet works is when you connect to the web, you do so with an internet service provider. Then you type in the domain name or website in the browser. Your computer then contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System servers. These act like phone books. They tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. Then the unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser. 
A web directory is organizing different files into groups just like you do with your other non-web-based files. Commonly they refer the containers of these files as “folders” because that’s exactly as they function. 
Using VCS is beneficial because everybody on a team is able to work freely, any file, any time. The VCS will allow you to merge all the changes into a common version. With VCS you can work in a team or on your own.
