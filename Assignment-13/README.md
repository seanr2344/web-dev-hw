# Assignment 13
## Sean Robinson

1.  Something new about Github that I learned is how to publish and share my website to my friends and family.

2. I learned how to transform (pop out) images, which enables a cool effect on an image.

3. Web development was a challenge. Learning how to code was a challenge as well. However, I learned many things in this class and while creating my final website I was able to learn many new techniques. Overall, I am happy with the end result.
