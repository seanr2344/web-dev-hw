1. My imaginary client was a blogger who wanted to set up their own blogging website for the public. The client had a love for frogs and writing. The client explained that she wanted a mixture of both in her website. The client also expressed that she wanted it to be a teaching website as well, where there would be external sources to teach viewers on blogging.

2. Elements with display: inline-block are like display: inline elements, but they can have a width and a height. It means when you can use an inline-block element as a block, while flowing it within text or other elements. With display: inline-block , the top and bottom margins/paddings are present, but with display: inline they are not.
