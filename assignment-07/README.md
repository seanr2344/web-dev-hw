1. The div tag is a unit that presents other page elements and divides the html document into groups. The class attribute specifies one or more class names. The id attribute specifies unique id for an html document. The span element in html is the generic container for phrasing content, can be used to group elements for styling purposes.

2. Alt text is a word or phrase that can be inserted as an attribute for HTML. We use it because it is to describe images to visitors who are unable to see them.

3. The only issue I ran into was the last step in creating the copyright section. I had trouble loading the multiple-source video. I realized that I did not export the files from the zipped file when I thought I did.
