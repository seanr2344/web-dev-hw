2. An IP address is an address assigned to any computer to identify it on a given network. A DNS address is a Domain Name Service which is used to convert alphabetic references into a server's IP address generally for hosting services.

3. Cookies are small pieces of information that websites store on your computer. Cookies only contain bits of text, not anything else.
