## Sean Robinson

I decided to take this class because I have always been interested in web design. This class will also count as a upper division credit that I need to graduate. I believe after completing this course, I have some knowledge in basic coding and web design to help me in my future.

A list of things in markdown:

- item 1 I hope to learn how to make a basic website.
- item 2 I have learned what github is.
- item 3 I have learned what the 3 basic parts of a URL are.
