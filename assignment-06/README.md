1. Most forms I come across while browsing the web are survey forms for job applications. They serve as a way for the employer to get to know a candidate more.

2. Input texts might be used in social media websites to put an appeal on younger kids. Selection may be used in online store websites where a customer can choose many categories on an item. An example of a button is a user that may use youtube. Anything on the youtube website can be pressed and an action, like pause, play, restart will occur for a video.
